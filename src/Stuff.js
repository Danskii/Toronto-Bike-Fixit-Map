        <p>I was riding my bike on Bloor Street one day and my front tire went flat.</p>
        <p>I had a spare but had forgotten my multi-tool at home.</p>
        <p>I remebered hearing about these FixIt stations that were popping up all over the 
          city and tried to remember where I saw one last. </p>
          <p>I could not remember. So when I got home I decided to map out all the locations in Toronto.</p>
          <p>Then I decided I might as well share the map with everyone.</p>
